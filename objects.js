then open this page in a browser and enter 'person' in the console */

    person.gender

called "greeting" that creates an alert dialog, then type person.greeting() into the console */

// rather than instatiating it from a class (which we will cover later).

/* STEP 5a: Dot syntax allows you to access the parts of an object - the first part is the namespace, 
and subsequent parts are used to access things encapsulated within the object. Access the name, age, 
and gender of the person object, and put it inside the <p id="output"></p>. */

/* STEP 6a: An object can even contain another object - update object person above to include a name object. 
Note how this breaks the greeting and bio functions - update the greeting function to use this sub-namespace */

/* STEP 6b: Now fix the bio() function to use the sub-namespace of 'name' as well */

/* STEP 7: You can also use bracket notation, just like an array - 
objects that are built this way are often referred to as associative arrays */

/* STEP 8: You can also set members of an object - try changing the person's name, and age */

This will become much clearer later in the course. Create two new objects, 
each with a name, and a function that outputs the name */

/* STEP 11b: Call up both person1.hello() and person2.hello() 
in the console to see how 'this' is specific to each object */

// You have already been using objects all along:
let myString = 'Words, words, words.'; // this creates an instance of the class String
